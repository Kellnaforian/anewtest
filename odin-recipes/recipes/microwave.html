    <h1>Taking the Lava out of Your Hot Pocket!</h1>
    <p>
        The first step to microwaving anything properly is to know that there is a super secret, super special button, called the power setting!
        What this button allows the microwave to do, is not blast your hot pocket with massive amounts of energy, heating up the most water dense areas of your pocket first. 
        This will result in a more evenly cooked Hot Pocket, that will hold you over until mommy makes tendies, without burning your entire mouth!

        <li>However long you normally put your meat wallet into the microwave, put double the time onto the screen</li>
        <li>The next step is to hit the power level button on your radiation machine, then hit 5. This will double the time it takes to cook your cheese volcano, but heat it more evenly</li>
        <li>The final step is to enjoy!</li>
